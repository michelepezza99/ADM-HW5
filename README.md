# Airport Network Analysis Project

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing the U.S. airport network by examining flight connections, detecting missing geographic coordinates, and applying network analysis techniques. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure completeness, and multiple centrality measures are computed to identify critical hubs in the network.

Additionally, the project explores community detection methods to uncover clusters of highly connected airports, providing insights into regional and functional groupings. Visualizations using interactive maps further enhance data interpretation.

### Features:
- **Data Cleaning & Geocoding:** Handles missing coordinates using hierarchical geocoding strategies.
- **Network Analysis:** Computes centrality measures like betweenness, closeness, degree, PageRank, and eigenvector centralities.
- **Community Detection:** Implements Louvain and Spectral Clustering algorithms to detect airport clusters.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Maps routes and connections using folium for dynamic exploration.
